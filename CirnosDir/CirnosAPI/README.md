------
split the food and order module to different files, moved the options to csv files, split the drink
food and order test files, entirely revamped the project for Sprint 4
------
Functions should be relatively self explanatory
To use, download CirnosDir and in your program import CirnosApi

Tests are included in the Unit_Tests folder and runs via pytest and
contains tests for every function, update your python test runner as needed

Use the get/set functions instead of using the _var of the drink, food, and order
objects for safety and error handling
